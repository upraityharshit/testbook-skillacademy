            Over the last decade, natural areas in the West–including forests, wetlands, deserts, and grasslands– have been lost to development at the rate of one football field every two and a half minutes. These remaining habitats are becoming smaller and increasingly fragmented (by roadways, development, and other human activity), making it more difficult or impossible for wildlife to access necessary resources.

            The diminished availability of suitable habitat has placed more than 300 California animal species at or near the brink of extinction, with many other western wildlife species also in severe decline. Sonoma County – located north of San Francisco – is known for its lush landscapes, yet it is accruing habitat loss 20% faster than other California counties and 80% faster than elsewhere in the US.
