    <h1>Holi</h1>
            
        <p>When most Westerners think of an Indian festival, they think of Holi. It’s one of the most celebrated festivals in the country and is famous for the vibrant coloured powders thrown through the streets. Red symbolises love and fertility; blue represents Krishna, a Hindu God; green represents new beginnings; and yellow represents turmeric, a powder native to India.</p>

        <p>  Holi is sometimes known as the Festival of Love, sometimes the Festival of Colour, but whatever you call it, Holi celebrates the triumph of good over evil. It lasts for a night and a day and is filled with singing, playing and waterbombs, while the celebrations begin on the first evening with a bonfire to burn Holika, a Hindu demoness.</p>
          
        <p> The festival changes dates based on the Hindu calendar, but usually occurs in March, on the last full moon day of the month marking spring.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The Holi festival is an ancient Hindu festival with its own cultural rituals which emerged before the Gupta period.[11] The festival of colours finds mentioned in numerous scriptures, such as in works like Jaimini's Purva Mimamsa Sutras and Kathaka-Grhya-Sutras with even more detailed descriptions in ancient texts like the Narada Purana and Bhavishya Purana. The festival of "holikotsav" was also mentioned in the 7th century work, Ratnavali, by King Harsha.[42] It is mentioned in the Puranas, Dasakumara Charita by Daṇḍin, and by the poet Kālidāsa during the 4th century reign of Chandragupta II.[11]</p>

    <p> The celebration of Holi is also mentioned in the 7th-century Sanskrit drama Ratnavali.[43] The festival of Holi caught the fascination of European traders and British colonial staff by the 17th century. Various old editions of the Oxford English Dictionary mention it, but with varying, phonetically derived spellings: Houly (1687), Hooly (1698), Huli (1789), Hohlee (1809), Hoolee (1825), and Holi in editions published after 1910.[19]</p>
