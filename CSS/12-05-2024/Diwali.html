            Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in India, marking the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It usually falls between October and November, depending on the lunar calendar. The festival spans five days, with each day holding special significance.

        <li>The festivities commence with Dhanteras, where people worship the goddess of wealth and purchase new items, especially gold or silver. The second day is Naraka Chaturdashi, when Lord Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura, symbolizing the victory of good over evil. This day is often celebrated with fireworks and the lighting of lamps.</li>

        <li>The third day, which is the main day of Diwali, is marked by Lakshmi Puja, where families gather to worship the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Houses are adorned with colorful decorations, rangolis (artistic designs made on the floor), and diyas (oil lamps). Delicious sweets and savories are prepared and exchanged among friends and family.</li>

        <li>The fourth day is Govardhan Puja, which commemorates Lord Krishna's lifting of Govardhan Hill to protect villagers from torrential rains. Finally, the fifth day is Bhai Dooj, dedicated to the bond between brothers and sisters.</li>

        <li>Diwali is not just celebrated in India but also by Indians worldwide. The festival embodies the spirit of unity, joy, and the triumph of light over darkness, making it a vibrant and culturally significant occasion.</li>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is likely a fusion of harvest festivals in ancient India.[47] It is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts, such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana, both of which were completed in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. The diyas (lamps) are mentioned in Skanda Kishore Purana as symbolising parts of the sun, describing it as the cosmic giver of light and energy to all life and which seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik.</p>

     <p> Emperor Harsha refers to Deepavali, in the 7th-century Sanskrit play Nagananda, as Dīpapratipadotsava (dīpa = light, pratipadā = first day, utsava = festival), where lamps were lit and newly engaged brides and grooms received gifts.[53][54] Rajasekhara referred to Deepavali as Dipamalika in his 9th-century Kavyamimamsa, wherein he mentions the tradition of homes being whitewashed and oil lamps decorated homes, streets and markets in the night.</p>
        
       <p> Diwali was also described by numerous travelers from outside India. In his 11th-century memoir on India, the Persian traveler and historian Al Biruni wrote of Deepavali being celebrated by Hindus on the day of the New Moon in the month of Kartika.[55] The Venetian merchant and traveler Niccolò de' Conti visited India in the early 15th-century and wrote in his memoir, "on another of these festivals they fix up within their temples, and on the outside of the roofs, an innumerable number of oil lamps... which are kept burning day and night" and that the families would gather, "clothe themselves in new garments", sing, dance and feast.[56][57] The 16th-century Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes wrote of his visit to the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire, where Dipavali was celebrated in October with householders illuminating their homes, and their temples, with lamps.[57] It is mentioned in the Ramayana that Diwali was celebrated for only 2 years in Ayodhya.[58]</p>
        
       <p>  Islamic historians of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire era also mentioned Diwali and other Hindu festivals. A few, notably the Mughal emperor Akbar, welcomed and participated in the festivities,[59][60] whereas others banned such festivals as Diwali and Holi, as Aurangzeb did in 1665.[61][62][e][f]
        </p>
        <p>   Publications from the British colonial era also made mention of Diwali, such as the note on Hindu festivals published in 1799 by Sir William Jones, a philologist known for his early observations on Sanskrit and Indo-European languages.[65] In his paper on The Lunar Year of the Hindus, Jones, then based in Bengal, noted four of the five days of Diwali in the autumn months of Aswina-Cartica [sic] as the following: Bhutachaturdasi Yamaterpanam (2nd day), Lacshmipuja dipanwita (the day of Diwali), Dyuta pratipat Belipuja (4th day), and Bhratri dwitiya (5th day). The Lacshmipuja dipanwita, remarked Jones, was a "great festival at night, in honour of Lakshmi, with illuminations on trees and houses"</p>
